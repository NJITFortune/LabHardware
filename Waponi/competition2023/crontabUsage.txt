This turns on the LepiLED at 6pm (18). There is currently no 
redundancy - if the LepiLED does not turn on at 6pm, it doesn't
turn on for that day. The assumption is that the LimeLight will
be deployed during daylight hours earlier.

*/10 19-24 * * * /home/arducam/bin/takePhotos.sh
*/10 0-6 * * * /home/arducam/bin/takePhotos.sh
We take photos every 10 minutes from 7pm until 6 am. There are two
cron entries as we go past midnight. The script turns on the lights
and then cycles through each camera, taking both an autofocus and
fixed focus image for each.

*/11 0-6 * * * /home/arducam/bin/PaneLightsOff.py
*/11 19-24 * * * /home/arducam/bin/PaneLightsOff.py
This turns off the Panel lights every 11 minutes to save energy. 
This could have been (and maybe should be) included in the 
takePhotos.sh script.

0 5 * * * /home/arducam/bin/LepiLEDoff.py
This turns of the LepiLED at 5am.
